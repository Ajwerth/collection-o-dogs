# Authentise Frontend Coding Challenge
Create a page to keep track of your favorite pictures of dog breeds.

## Result
The page should allow the user to
- Search for a breed and add it to the collection
- Remove a breed from the collection
- Add a random breed to the collection
- Each breed in the collection should show the name and an image.

## Assumptions
- A breed can only be added to the collection one time
- Sub-breeds cannot be added

## Rules
- You must use the Dog CEO API as your data source
- Use React.js or Vanilla Javascript to complete the assignment
- We expect this to take about 3 hours, but bear in mind that finished is better than partly-finished.
- Provide instructions for running the project
- Add you project to github and send us the link to the repo
